<h1>Book Bag&nbsp;</h1>
<p> Sometimes,</p>
<p>my friends and I talk about books.</p>
<p>We bargain and barter, exchanging one for another--</p>
<p>shopping from each other,</p>
<p>bookshelves, stacks, and crates.</p>
<p>Acquired from holidays, the book loft, and each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes covered in dust bunnies</p>
<p>and hair that seems to be everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what happens when you live with eight people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We loan each other</p>
<p>easy reads</p>
<p>that fly by on a friday night.</p>
<p>We loan each other</p>
<p>meaningfulness</p>
<p>and thoughts.</p>
<p>I love that we do both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
